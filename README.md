# Tweet-classification
Natural Language Processing as one of the branches of artificial intelligence deals
with text document processing. Text classification as one of the important tasks in
NLP addresses the problem of classifying a collection of textual documents into two
or more categories which are labeled in a way that each group reflects a particular
subject. The classification based on sentiment analysis focuses on categorizing the
documents according to the attitude and emotions of the writer towards a particular
object or subject under discussion. In this project a collection of manually labeled
tweets about the Corona virus was selected to classify them into three classes,
'Negative', 'Neutral', and 'Positive', based on the underlying emotions conveyed by
them. Naive Bayes, Ensemble methods, and LSTM models were built to carry out the
task. From the performance perspective, LSTM outperforms the other methods, and
ensemble methods did a better job compared with Naive Bayes. Considering the
assumptions of the models we may infer that the dependency between the features in
the contextual data processing is an important aspect to be considered.
